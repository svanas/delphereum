## What is Delphereum?

Delphereum is a Delphi interface to the Ethereum blockchain that allows for development of native dApps (aka _decentralized_ applications).

## What is Delphi?

[Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) is a development environment that compiles into native apps for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.

## What is Ethereum?

[Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) is a blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring Smart Contracts.

## What is a Smart Contract?

A Smart Contract is a computation that takes place on a blockchain or distributed ledger. You can think of a Smart Contract as a microservice that runs trustless on the backend of your application. Once added to the blockchain, a Smart Contract becomes public and cannot be modified or removed. This assures your users that the rules are transparent and will never change.

## What is a dApp?

A dApp is an application whose backend runs on a decentralised network with trustless protocols. dApps aren’t owned by anyone, cannot be shut down, and have zero downtime.

## Dependencies

Before you can compile this project, you will need to clone the following repositories, and then add them to your Delphi Library path:
```
git clone https://github.com/rvelthuis/DelphiBigNumbers
git clone https://github.com/Xor-el/SimpleBaseLib4Pascal
git clone https://github.com/Xor-el/HashLib4Pascal
git clone https://github.com/Xor-el/CryptoLib4Pascal
```
Please note there are NO runtime dependencies. Delphereum is lightweight and self-contained.
